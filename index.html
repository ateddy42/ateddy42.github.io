						<a class="parlink" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ateddy42/NeuralNet">GitHub Repository</a>
						<p>I noticed there aren't too many neural network implementations written in Java, so decided to try my hand at one. I tried to make it as customizable as possible, and to support a number of configurations. This was originally created in conjunction with my <a class="parlink" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ateddy42/t4">Tic Tac Toe</a> game, but also works well with the <a class="parlink" target="_blank" href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST</a> dataset and classifying handwritten digits. The simmulated annealing doesn't work that well yet, but I hope to improve it in the future. It would also be nice to import and export the current state, allowing you to better debug and see what the network is doing.</p>

						<p>I wrote this game simply as a test for my <a class="parlink" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ateddy42/NeuralNet">Neural Network</a> implementation in Java. It has very basic functionality to let you put two players against each other, either human or AI. There is one AI that randomly selects a square, another that was my first attempt at implementing the neural net, and a third that tries to backpropagate every time an invalid move is tried.</p>
						<p>For the future, I'd like to add a new AI that takes board rotation into consideration to help the AI learn even faster, but I haven't quite figured out the best hashing/sorting algorithm. It would also be nice to be able to save the state of a game and import a saved game.</p>

						<p>I developed a website from scratch using Django (roughly 6,000 lines of code written). It includes both a front-end section for the public to view (link above), and a hidden section for viewing individual accounts, social deposits, house points, etc, as well as a wiki with a page for each brother. It was written using the Foundation framework, and is mobile optimized.</p>

						<p>Used for a few organizations I'm a part of, I developed a website to allow people to sign in at meetings by filling out personal info, taking a picture with a webcam, and uploading it to a server. The head of the organization can later log in and view a list of all the guests that day, and there is a mirrored site for other members of the group to view the guest that the head is currently reviewing. I am currently fixing bugs and will be putting the code up on GitHub soon.</p>

						<a class="parlink" target="_blank" href="./img/4220FinalReport.pdf">Final Report</a>
						<p>The final project for our Networks II class involved investigating the effects of information cascades via the anonymous social media application, Yik Yak. We posted a variety of text posts on the application and recorded the results as people 'upvoted' and 'downvoted' them. We then used a large number of users to sway the number of votes in either the positive or negative direction, and tried to see if this created an information cascade where the post received a much higher or lower score than the control.</p>

We wrote the entire gameplay and interactions between characters, as well as an AI to beat all the other AIs in a class-wide tournament, all in the <i>wonderful</i> language of OCaml. Although we ran out of time due to impending finals week, we ended up winning 2nd place in the tournament, even after choosing Metapod (no attack moves, just defense).</p>

						<p>Studying Wikipedia “Article for Deletion” discussions, we analyzed the series of votes cast by users, along with their rationale for their votes, finding evidence that information cascades occur. We investigated a number of language-centric features to understand the qualities of positive and negative cascades, and to see which posts have more influence over future posts. We use our findings to build a classifier that predicts the extent to which a cascade will grow in a discussion. We found not only that information cascades exist in these discussions, but that cascades in discussions are reasonably predictable, which is somewhat surprising given their subtlety.</p>

						<p>Starting in Fall 2015, I began migrating the CS Course Management System (CMS) from Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) to the Java Persistence API (JPA). The new system I implemented was deployed in production for a select number of courses in Spring 2017. It was deployed side-by-side with a server running Classic CMS, and the application redirected students to the correct server based on the courses they were accessing. I implemented a number of new features, including 'slip day' tracking, an auto-grader extension, and a command-line interface (CLI) to interract with the system.</p>

						<p>I wrote a CLI/API to generate aggregate metrics of Customer Systems Risk results (aka ARS - At Risk Systems). This is then displayed to customers to give them an idea of the top N risks affecting them based on severity, number of systems affected, etc. Another project was to identify correlations between specific risks and system failures, and alert customers with preventative actions.</p>
